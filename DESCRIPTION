Description: An R package for subset-based analysis of heterogeneous traits and disease subtypes. 
	The package allows the user to search through all possible subsets of z-scores to 
	identify the subset of traits giving the best meta-analyzed z-score. Further, it returns a p-value
	adjusting for the multiple-testing involved in the search. It also allows for searching for the 
	best combination of disease subtypes associated with each variant.
